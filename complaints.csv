Which was not the case. I wanted to see all the bills and the receipts in writing. So she apologized. And was like Ill get this out to you. Now today, I think it was a week ago. They called again. I called them back. Got a man. He was talking super slow. So i thought he was done, I said yeah I am still waiting for the receipt you guys are refusing to send me. He immediately snapped well let me finish. Did his little attempt to collect a debt spiel and hung up on me. So I dont know if they are fraud? Or trying to work me overtime? But I can not get a receipt. And they keep marking me a refusal to pay when they wont send me the information that I have requested at least 3 times. They say the same exact thing every time.

I have been dealing with them for several months regarding my son 's student loan that I co-signed on. Due to both of us losing our jobs in XXXX through XXXX and not being able to gain employment until XXXX, we could not pay on the student loans. This summer during the month of XXXX and XXXX I started getting calls and emails to my work number and work email address. I filed a complaint to you all and they have stop doing that. I told them I could only pay {$200.00} per month on the loans which I did in XXXX and XXXX. Three days after I made the XXXX payment, they defaulted on the loans. Then I get an email from their recovery unit about options. They started calling me again, during work hours. I sent several emails advising them of my options to pay {$200.00} per month and that calling me during work hours is not an option. There is no available time to call them after work or weekends since they only accept calls during XXXX to XXXX eastern time. I am on the XXXX time zone so those hours are either too early in the morning for me or not late enough in the evening. So I have ONLY one way of communicating with them and that is through email. I get an email today saying that I have not tried to contact them and that if I don't then they have no option but to go to the next level. Well that is a complete lie. I have contacted them SEVERAL TIMES through email. They only responded once through email telling me that the payment option I provided them was not acceptable. I don't feel that Navient wants to works this out in good faith and just going through the motion to pretend that they are. I have asked for documentation on options and they refused to give me any. They just simply ignore my emails and continue to call during hours that I am not available. I really don't understand why Consumer Financial Services or XXXX XXXX XXXX is not going after Navient. They break all debt collection regulations by calling/emailing people at their employment. They hack into businesses network to get email addresses ( that is the only way they could have gotten my work email ). I don't know what else to do.
